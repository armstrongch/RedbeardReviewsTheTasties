                        <td colspan=3>From day one, Klondike bars have been a quality, bare-bones ice cream treat. Do you like dark chocolate? Do you like vanilla ice cream? Do you like ice cream bars? Then you will certainly appreciate this down-to-earth celebration of the basics in a foil wrapper.

			<td>5/17/2017</td>
			<td colspan=3>This is a prime example of making the most with what you've got. Other than it's budget price (compared to other convenience store ice creams,) cumberland farms' brand ice cream has little going for it. However, it makes up for it's underwhelming DQ-calibur base with an overload of fudge and peanutbutter cups. Every bite is saturated with candy, making this a delightful addition to the shelves of any Cumbies.</td>

			<td>5/17/2017</td>
			<td colspan=3>Very disappointing. Stop and Shop's Gelato is price almost a dollar less per pint than the Talenti that it shares a shelf with, so it's seated in a prime position to dethrone the current king of the tasties. However, it is bland from the first bite. This gelato reminds me of a slightly fruity shade of vanilla, with none of it's classic charm. Other peach-flavored yum-yums put this to shame, and the guava flavor is absent altogether. I found myself wondering why I continued to spoon it down my gullet, and the pint was left less than half finished after a single sitting.</td>

			<td>5/17/2017</td>
			<td colspan=3>This unassuming Talenti pint is a flavorful powerhouse. Not only is the key lime flavor smooth and sweet (but not saccharine), but it has just enough of a kick to keep you on your toes. The crumbly, nuggest of pie crust hidden under the surface are enough to keep anyone digging, and this particular flavor rarely survives a single sitting.</td>

			<td>6/3/2017</td>
			<td colspan=3> Nestle's Vanilla Caramel Drumstick is all about synergy. By themselves, the roasted peanuts, chocolate shell, vanilla ice cream, and classic cone are merely pedestrian, but together they are a delightfully crunchy, sweet, single-serving of bliss. The caramel core is a pleasantly surprising addition to the classic formula, and these tasty treats are a reliable favorite from your local ice cream truck.</td>

            <td colspan=3>If you have the pleasure of interacting with the Victoria Station Cafe's enthusiastic ice cream specialist, you'll know right away that you're in for a unique experience. All of the ice cream is homemade using all natural ingredients, and many of the flavors are unconventional and designed by the man behind the scoop himself. Case in point, the strawberry rhubarb ice cream boasts a 1:1 ratio of real strawberries and real rhubarb, along with a variety of spices, working together to produce a unique blend of tastes and textures. Perfect for the adventurous (dessert-related) thrill-seekers, the Victoria Station Cafe is one of Connecticut's ice cream landmarks.</td>

            <td colspan=3>Typically, in the pursuit of the tasties, the "100 calorie", "healthy" alternate snacks are a red flag, sacrificing fat and sugar in a bland imitation of their full sweetened couterparts. I'm excited to proclaim the Yasso frozen Greek yogurt  bars as an exception to the rule, boasting a full flavor, chock-full of chocolate chips and cookie dough. My only complaint is their disposition to freezerburn, and their inadequate size. Reccomended serving size: three bars.</td>
